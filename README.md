# Treesand Graphs Data Structures
These are some implementations of Trees and Graphs data structures in C#.
Trees and Graphs are recursive data structures which consists of nodes connected with edges.
I used the Breadth-First-Search (BFS) and Depth-First-Search (DFS) algorithms in the implementations.
